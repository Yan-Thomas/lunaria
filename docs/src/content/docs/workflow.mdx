TODO.

{
// Lunaria was made to help open-source communities feel empowered to handle complex localization projects, and thanks to our experience doing so, we've gathered a few suggestions on how to use Lunaria to its full potential.

// ## Keep pull requests small

// - More friendly and resonable to new reviewers.
// - Easier to keep track for changes, discuss, and iterate.
// - Localization reaches users faster (use temporary branches in case everything has to be localized before publishing!)

// ## Use squashed merge commits

// - Better control over the final status, especially when dealing with new contributors
// - Tracker Directives can be used for fine-grained tracking status

// ## Empower the community

// - Value the work of reviewers as well
// - Create resources for new contributors to jump in
// - Explain the project's localization architecture and Lunaria
