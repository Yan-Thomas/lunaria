Lunaria is an **localization management toolchain** for open-source projects, giving the tools necessary for both maintainers and contributors to build a seamless and efficient localization workflow.

## Why Lunaria?

As a maintainer, managing localization efforts has never been easy, you'd always have to sacrifice the ownership of your content by moving into a localization platform or give up on reliably tracking your content for changes, until now. Lunaria solves both of these problems by enabling an entirely new workflow, powered by Git.

Every commit to select files is used to build a localization dashboard, giving each file its respective done/outdated/missing status. From the dashboard, maintainers get a detailed overview of their project's localization status while contributors receive all the information they need to efficiently help, including links to the missing files and a list of commits that need to be added to the outdated content.

## Add to your project

You can quickly add Lunaria to your project by running the following command in your terminal:

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="npm">

```sh
npm create lunaria@latest
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="pnpm">

```sh
pnpm create lunaria
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Yarn">

```sh
yarn create lunaria
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

This command will automatically create a new `lunaria.config.json` file, include an easy-to-use `lunaria` command to your `package.json`, and add all the necessary dependencies for your specific project.

:::note
The `create-lunaria` setup wizard currently does not walk you through configuring the `lunaria.config.json` file. Visit the Reference section to manually proceed instead.
